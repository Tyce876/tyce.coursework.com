            <h2>The Evolution and Significance of Sports Management: Navigating the Business of Play</h2>
            <img src="img/def.jpg" alt="Main Banner" title="Main Banner">
            Sports, once primarily an arena for athletic prowess and entertainment, has transformed into a multi-billion-dollar industry with a global reach. This transformation has led to the emergence and growth of sports management, a crucial discipline that plays a pivotal role in the administration, organization, and optimization of all aspects related to sports. From team operations to event management, marketing to athlete representation, sports management has become an indispensable element in the business of play.

            Historical Context and Growth
            
           <p> The roots of sports management can be traced back to the early 20th century,<br>
